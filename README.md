Learning to Compress Graphs via Dual Agents for Consistent Topological Robustness Evaluation

Our framework employs two deep reinforcement learning agents that collaboratively compress the original graph. The resulting compressed graph preserves the original network’s robustness profile, exhibiting similar degradation patterns when subjected to adversarial attacks.

Requirements The codebase is implemented in Python 3.12.7. package versions used for development are just below.  
pytorch 2.7.1  
tqdm 4.66.5  
networkx  3.4.2

Thank you very much for your interest in this project. :smile:  
At the moment, I’m deep in the trenches working on a new paper, so the full, well-organized version of the code isn’t quite ready yet. :dizzy_face:  
I’ll clean everything up soon — complete with comments, polished modules, and the full test datasets.  

Just bear with me a little longer… the tidy version is on its way! :neckbeard:
